### Separate Files Implementation

The code is primarily split into various files, each handling a specific part of the model. Please refer to the individual files for detailed implementation and comments.

### Combined Implementation (`AlgorithmicTraderModel.py`)

In case the separate files implementation does not work on your system, a combined code file named [`AlgorithmicTraderModel.py`](./AlgorithmicTraderModel.py) is provided. Simply run this file instead of the separate ones.

### Jupyter Lab Notebook

A Jupyter Lab Notebook is included, showcasing thorough testing and documentation of the code. It provides insights into the development process and the testing performed on the algorithms. [Click here to view the notebook](./your_notebook_name.ipynb).

### How to Use

1. **For Combined Code**:Simply run the `AlgorithmicTradingModel.py` file in a Python environment that meets the requirements. 
2. **For Separate Files Implementation**: If facing any issues with the combine file AlgorithmicTradingModel.py Simply run the main.py file from the AlgorithmicTrader folder
3. **For Notebook Exploration**: Open the provided  to see detailed testing and evaluation.
